# Electronjs_miniprojects

This is a collection of 4 projects which I have built using ElectronJS. Electron helps us in building Desktop type apps by using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
The $ projects which I have built are :
<br/>
<ul>
<li>Task App</li>
<li>VideoInfo</li>
<li>Todo App</li>
<li>Convertify App</li>
</ul>
<br>
Notable menion is the <b><i>Convertify app</i><b>, which I have integrated with React, to perform the function of converting any video files that have been selected, into any of the 5 video formats. Also additionally,
it also shows you the length of the video file. I have used the popular FFMPEG library to achieve this.
